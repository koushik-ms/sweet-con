# Sweet Con - A Rich and featured contacts store

This is an attempt at creating an app for storing contact information using firebase. It incorporates Sign-in with google, database & hosting functionality courtesy firebase.

Primary purpose in taking up the project is to learn the use of firebase components/ features and advanced HTML and Javascript (nodejs, npm, ...).

## Features / Requirements

*Done*
1. Allow user to login with google.
2. allow user to create new contact (name, address, email)
3. save data locally and on the cloud
4. secure data stored on the cloud (each user's data visible to ONLY that user.)
5. Persist contact data locally. Make it accessible offline.
5. clear local data on sign-out/ logoff.
6. Make the web-app progressive (add manifest/ sw regn)
7. 

*Planned/ ToDo*
1. Add option to store social media handles (github & twitter mainly).
2. Update view design for na-note to display multiple social data-fields.
3. Add facility to add contact image. take photo via mediacapture - [what web can do](https://whatwebcando.today).
4. Sync contact with local phone contact. Maybe useful to map... at least avoid double store of phone number. Perhaps allow user to "migrate" phone contact into app?!?
